			Automata Inc. produces specialty vehicles by contract. The company operates several departments, each one of which builds a particular vehicle, such as a limousine, a truck, a van, or an RV. Incoming orders are handles by the Customer Service Department. Transactions of delivery and payment are also done by this department. Once an order is processed and registered, it is dispatched to a construction department based on the vehicle type. The Customer Service Department keeps customer- and order-related information and also maintains a file of which vehicle is being built by which department.
			<br><br>
			Each construction department maintains its own job list in order of incoming sequence. Although the jobs are processed one by one, there are often several vehicles being built in the production line, each at a different stage. The department keeps a progress log on each vehicle. Technicians will sign on the log after they are done with their parts on one vehicle and then move on to the next. Once a vehicle is finished, it is turned over to the Customer Service Department together with all the records.

			When a new vehicle is built, the construction department places an order with the purchasing department to request specific components. The order received by the purchasing department can contain several different items. An inventory is maintained so that the most frequently requested items are delivered almost immediately. When an order comes in, it is checked to determine whether the requested item is in inventory. If an item is not in inventory, it must be ordered from a supplier. Each item may have several suppliers.
			<br><br>
			The personnel and accounting departments already have their database systems to keep things going and they are not considering to upgrade their systems any time soon.
